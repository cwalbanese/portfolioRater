          This application is named Portfolio Rater. It is a way for users to
          receive feedback on their professional portfolios. You may post your
          portfolio to be listed on the website, where other users can comment
          on the portfolio and provide feedback.
        </p>

          This is beneficial to you, as it serves as a mock step of the job
          employment process. But without the pressure! Receiving feedback on
          your portfolio will boost confidence levels. It also provides
          constructive criticism to improve your portfolio even more!
        </p>
        <p>
          This application was created as a collaborative project between
          software engineers: Chris Albanese, Skyler Bond, and Jarod McGill.
