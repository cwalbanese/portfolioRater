        This application is named Portfolio Rater. It is a way for users to
        receive feedback on their professional portfolios. You may post your
        portfolio to be listed on the website, where other users can comment on
        the portfolio and provide feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is beneficial to you, as it serves as a mock step of the job
        employment process. But without the pressure! Receiving feedback on your
        portfolio will boost confidence levels. It also provides constructive
        criticism to improve your portfolio even more!
      </p>
      <p>
        This application was created as a collaborative project between software
        engineers: Chris Albanese, Skyler Bond, and Jarod McGill.
